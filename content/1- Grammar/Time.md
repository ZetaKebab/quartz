> While I was on the train, I was playing a game.

## 間に

<div class="usage">
<div class="left">
	<p><span class="box">V (casual, non-past)</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">い-Adj</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">な-Adj + な</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">N + の</span></p>
</div>
	<p class="right">+ 間に</p>
</div>

A first meaning is similar to {間|あいだ} (while), but with intentionality.

> [!info] Example
> 電車に{乗|の}った==間に==、本を読みました。
> While I was on the train, I read a book.

A second meaning is a statement of something that happened during a time period, independently of your actions.
Contrary to 間, it doesn't include the whole time period. So 間に means that at a point during the time period, something happened.

> [!info] Example
> {夜|よる}の==間に==、{隣|となり}の木が{落|お}ちていた。
> During the night, the tree next door fell.

<div class="left">
	<p><span class="box">V (dictionary)</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">N + の</span></p>
</div>
	<p class="right">+ 前に</p>
</div>

{前|まえ}に means before (time) or in front of (place).

> [!info] Examples
> {寝|ねる}る==前に==、レストランに行こうと思います。
> I think I'll go to the restaurant before sleeping.
>

## 後で

<div class="usage">
<div class="left">
	<p><span class="box">V (た)</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">N + の</span></p>
</div>
	<p class="right">+ 後で</p>
</div>

{後|あと}で means after or later.
⚠ Only works with the past form of verbs!

> [!info] Example
> 食べた==後で==、寝ます。
> After eating, I'll go to sleep.

## さっき

Means that something happened recently, either just now, or a little while ago.

> [!info] Example
> ==さっき==家に出てきた。
> I just left home.

## たところ

Combined with a verb in the past tense, it express that something just occurred (something just ended, just started, etc).

> [!info] Example
> 今食べた==ところ==だ。
> I just finished to eat right now.

## ているところ

See [[TeF (2) - manner of doing#ているところ]].

## たばかり

Combined with a verb in the past tense, it express that something just occurred (something just ended, just started, etc). It is more subjective than ところ. It doesn't have to be something that literally just happened, but something that feels like it just happened. 

> [!info] Example
> 今食べた==ばかり==だ。
> I just finished to eat right now.

When comparing the two examples, the meaning is different depending on the context. Imagine a friend asking you to go eat with him. When using ところ, it means you just finished your meal this instant. When using ばかり, it means that it feels too soon to eat again just yet from your point of view, independently of how much time has really passed.

## 急に

{急|きゅう}に means that something happened unexpectedly or quickly.

> [!info] Example
> ==急に==電車が{現|あらわ}れた。

## やっと

> [!info] Example
> ==やっと=={論文|ろん|ぶん}を書き{終|お}わった。
> I finally finished writing my thesis.
 
## までに

This indicates a time limit for the action, similar to "by".

> [!info] Example
> {来週|らい|しゅう}==までに=={終|お}わってください。
> Please finish by next week.

## おきに

This is used for repeated intervals, after a noun indicating something measurable.

> [!info] Example

> This train leaves every four minutes.
