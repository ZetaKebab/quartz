</div>
	<p class="right">+ ので</p>
</div>

Used after a reason, to explain the consequence. Means "because of", "since".
It is more objective than から: it expresses a situation that exists, and that is outside of one's control. For this reason, it can also be perceived as more polite.

> 雨な==ので==傘を持ってきてください。
> Since it is raining, please bring an umbrella.

## から

It is more subjective than ので: it expresses more personal needs/actions/opinions.
