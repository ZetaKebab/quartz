# 4- Te-Form - even if

For **verbs**, **adjectives** and **nouns**.

## Even if: ても・でも

Works by adding も to the Te-Form.

> [!info] Example
> 安==くても==、買いません。
> Even if it's cheap, I won't buy it.
> 
> 好き==でも==、買えなかった。
> Even if I liked it, I didn't bought it.

### てもいい

Means that something is "alright". Frequently used for questions.

> [!info] Example
> ここに{座|すわ}==ってもいい==？
> Is it okay if I sit here?
> 
> {冷|つめ}たい==でもいい==。
> It's okay even if it's cold.

### ても～なくても

Means "whether or not". A form a bit strange, where the verb is repeated two times in the following manner: VてもVなくても.

> [!info] Example
> 食べ==ても==食べ==なくても==、{構|かま}いません。
> It doesn't matter whether you eat it orb not.

### ても{構|かま}わない

Means that it doesn't matter or that the speaker doesn't mind.

> [!info] Example
> 雨が{降|ふ}==っても構わない==。
> I don't mind if it rains.

### ても{始|はじ}まらない

Means that even if you do it, it will never start: that it's no use.
Only for **verbs**.

> [!info] Example
> この時間に会==っても始まらない==。
> There's no point meeting at this time of the day.

### いくら～ても・どんなに～ても

Means "no matter how much".

> [!info] Example
> ==いくら==好き==でも==、買えません。
> No matter how much you like it, I won't buy it for you.
> 
> ==どんなに==高==くても==、買います。
> No matter how expensive, I'll buy it.

### たとえ〜ても

Used to make a supposition. Would translate to something like "even if... is the case".

> [!info] Example
> ==たとえ=={新幹線|しん|かん|せん}==でも==、１時間かかる。
> Even if you take the Shinkansen, it will take one hour.
