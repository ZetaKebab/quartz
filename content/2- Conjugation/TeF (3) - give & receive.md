# Te-Form (3) - give & receive

Extends the common forms of あげる, くれる, and もらう, but what is received or given is now a verb, instead of a noun.

## てあげる

Expresses that someone is doing or did something for someone else.
The person that received the favor is followed by the に particle.
Only for **verbs**.

> [!info] Example
> 母にケーキを買==ってあげた==。
> I bought a cake for my mother.
> 

For casual language, ==てやる== can be used.

## てくれる

Used to ask a favor from someone or to say that something was done to the speaker.
The person that received the favor (usually oneself and thus omitted) is followed by the に particle.
Only for **verbs**.

> [!info] Example
> {友達|とも|だち}がギターを{教|おし}え==てくれる==。
> My friend will teach me the guitar.

### てくれてありがとう

This form expresses gratitude for something that benefited the speaker. It is not used for something expected.
Only for **verbs**.

> [!info] Example
> 今日来==てくれてありがとう==！
> Thank you for coming today!

## てもらう

This form expresses gratitude for a favor that the recipient generally requested for, or where gratitude is the focus.
Only for **verbs**.

> {友達|とも|だち}が手伝==ってもらった==。
> My friend helped me (and I owe him / because I asked him and I am grateful)

## てくれない・てもらえない

Used as a mean to ask for a favor like "would you, could you?". Used in a similar form to じゃないか.
