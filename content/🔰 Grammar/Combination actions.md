## ～込む

~{込|こ}む has multiple meanings depending on the verb. Sometimes it is idiomatic and so it cannot exactly be guessed. However, there are some broad categories.

⚠ Depending on the context, verbs can fall into multiple categories!

### Going into

* If the verb describes a movement, adding 込む add the meaning of "into" (jumping => jumping into).
* If the verb already has a notion of "into", it put emphasis into it. It could have a meaning like "completely into".

> [!info] Example
> {海|うみ}に{飛|とび}び==込んだ==。
> He jumped into the ocean.

### Emphasis

When the verb does not include physical movement, 込む can be used to put emphasis on certain verbs (deeply, a lot, etc).

> [!info] Example
> {猫|ねこ}が{眠|ねむ}り==込んでいます==。
> The cat is fast asleep.

### Repetition

The last common meaning is for an action that is repeated until a point is reached. It can also be an action that is done for a long time.

> [!info] Example
> {毎朝|まいあさ}5キロ{走|かし}り==込む==。
> Every morning I go for a 5km run (emphasis on the fact that it is a long run).
