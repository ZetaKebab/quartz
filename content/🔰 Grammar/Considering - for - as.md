## "As": Gradual change

<div class="usage">
<div class="left">
	<p><span class="box">V + (の)</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">N + だ</span></p>
</div>
	<p class="right">+ につれて・にしたがって・と共に・に伴って</p>
</div>

The four following forms have the same meaning of a gradual change:
* につれて
* にしたがって
* と{共|とも}に
* に{伴|とも}って

It means that when when the first part of the sentence changes, the second part changes gradually as well.

> [!info] Example
> {年|とし}をとる==につれて=={髪|かみ}を{抜|ぬ}けます。
> As we get older, we lose hair.

This example works with all forms.

## につれて and にしたがって

In both forms, the change is natural, and is not an intentional change. When the verb expresses gradual change, both can be used.
につれて is more common and more used for personal actions.

> [!info] Example
> {冬|ふゆ}が{地|ちか}づく==にしたがって・につれて=={気温|きおん}が{下|さ}がってきた。
> As winter approaches, the temperatures have lowered.

## にしたがって

This form also has the meaning of "in accordance to". It doesn't express change. It is possible to talk about intention.

> [!info] Example
> {歯医者|はいしゃ}==にしたがって=={毎日|まいにち}２{回|かい}{歯|は}を{磨|みが}く。
> I brush my teeth twice a day as recommended by my dentist.

## に伴って

に{伴|ともな}って also has the meaning of a an instantaneous change: when the first part changes, the second part also changes instantly. The first part is the reason of it changing.

> [!info] Example
> オリンピックがある==に伴って=={交通費|こうつうひ}がねあが{値上|ねあ}がりしてしまった。
> As the Olympics are held, transportations cost have increased.

## と共に

と{共|とも}に has 3 other meanings.

### Almost at the same time

It is also used for two actions that happens at approximately the same time. The two actions do not have to be related. They also don't have to be specifically about change.

> [!info] Example
> {鳥|とり}は{鳴|な}き{声|ごえ}をする==と共に=={風|かぜ}が{吹|ふ}く。
> The bird sings and the wind blows.

### Together with

It can also mean "together with". It is much more formal than {一緒|いっしょ}に.

> [!info] Example
> {妻|つま}==と共に=={新|あたら}しい{人生|じんせい}を{始|はじ}めります。
> I am starting a new life with my wife.

### As well as, also

It can also mean "as well as", "also".

> [!info] Example
> パンはチーズ==と共に==フランスに{人気|にんき}{食料|しょくりょう}です。
> Bread, along with cheese, is a popular food in France.
