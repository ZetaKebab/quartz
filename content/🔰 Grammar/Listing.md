# Listing

## Connecting sentences

### そして

This conjunction means "and". It implies a cause-effect relationship between the two sentences. There's an interconnection, where the order of the actions cannot be changed.

> [!info] Examples
> バスケットボールをした。==そして==水を{飲|の}んだ。
> I played basketball. Then, I drank water.

### それから

This conjunction means "and" or "after that". It implies a chronological order to the events. Since there's no interconnection, the order of actions could be changed.

> [!info] Examples
> スーパーに行きました。==それから=={弁当|べんとう}を食べました。
> I went to the supermarket. After that, I ate my bento.

### それに

This conjunction means "and", "besides" or "in addition". Implies a new information in relation to the precedent one. It is not used to add a negative information to a positive one, and vice-versa.

> [!info] Examples
> 昨日、{病気|びょうき}になった。==それに==パソコンも{壊|こわ}れた。
> I got sick yesterday. Beside, my computer broke.

### それで

Means "because of that", "therefore". Substitutes the first sentence happening before by それ, highlighting information from it.
