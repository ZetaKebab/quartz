# Japanese Grammar

Welcome to my Japanese Grammar project!

## Goal

The goal of this website is to be a synthesis of useful resources for my Japanese learning adventure. I want to have grammar points next to each other, independently of any "difficulty level", set up in a logical and consistent form. I don't want to have to open 5 pages to compare information, and I don't want a deep dive into a notion. The goal is to be a reminder of the things I learn, rather than a way to learn. I want a few examples to grasp it, but I do not want to have ten of the same kind. And nothing quite fits for me!

## Sources

Of course, since I'm _learning_ the language, I need to get inspired from different sources. So this website partly uses information from the websites listed here. I don't want any recognition of what is here! It's mostly a compilation of what people who are way better in this language have made before.
