### ていく・てくる

ていく combines the Te-form with the verb 行く.
てくる combines the Te-form with the verb 来る. 
Both can be used when representing time or a physical place. Kanji and hiragana can be used, and they can be conjugated.
Only for **verbs**.

The first meaning is the following:
* ていく means to go and do something.
* てくる means to do and come back.
