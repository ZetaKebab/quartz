> バスケットボールをした。==そして==水を{飲|の}んだ。
> I played basketball. Then, I drank water.

### それから

This conjunction means "and" or "after that". It implies a chronological order to the events. Since there's no interconnection, the order of actions could be changed.

> I went to the supermarket. After that, I ate my bento.

### それに

This conjunction means "and", "besides" or "in addition". Implies a new information in relation to the precedent one. It is not used to add a negative information to a positive one, and vice-versa.

### それで

Means "because of that", "therefore". Substitutes the first sentence happening before by それ, highlighting information from it.
