### Summing it up

🛠 To do: check validity.

* ==ようだ== is a formal way to say that it looks like, usually from direct observation.
* ==みたい== is a less formal way, used in a casual conversation.
* ==っぽい== is even more casual. A girl trying to be masculine would be 男っぽい.
* ==らしい== is usually used when something is typical or expected. The same girl wouldn't be either 女らしい or 男っぽい because it's not what is expected from her.
* ==そうだ== is used for something that is hearsay or not directly observation, more as a guess.
