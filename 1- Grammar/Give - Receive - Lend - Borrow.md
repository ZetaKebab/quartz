### When to use?

#### Giving

There's a nuance between the two terms depending on who you are close to.
The general rule is that you:
* use ==あげる== if you, your friends or family give something to others (closer to giver's side).
* use ==くれる== if you, your friends or family are receiving things from others (closer to receiver's side).

In both cases, the topic is the giver.

#### Receiving

There's only one word: ==もらう==, and it doesn't matter who you are close to.

In this case, the topic is the receiver.
