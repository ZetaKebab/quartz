# Opposition

## が

Between two sentences, it has the meaning of "but".

> [!info] Example
> この{建物|たてもの}は大きいです==が==、トイレは{一|ひと}つだけあります。
> This building is huge but has only one toilet.

## でも

This is the basic way to say "but".

> [!info] Example
> コンビニに行きました。==でも==、何も買わなかった。
> I went to the convenience store. But I didn't buy anything.

## しかし

This is similar to でも, meaning "however", but usually more formal and most commonly found in written form.

> [!info] Example
> {戦争|せん|そう}は{悪|わる}いこと。==しかし==、{人類|じん|るい}はいつも{戦|たたか}っています
> War is bad. However, humanity is always fighting.

## けど・けれども

けれども is more formal than けど. Contrary to でも (which is more stand-alone), this links two clauses. The second clause can also be implicit and not said.

> [!info] Example
> {外|そと}は{暑|あつ}い==けど==行きたい。
> It's hot outside but I'd still like to go.

It can also be used to soften your assertion.

> [!info] Example
> {明日|あした}に行きたい==けど==。
> I'd like to go tomorrow... (but I don't want to cause any inconvenience).
