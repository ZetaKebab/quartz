# Observation: hearsay

## んだって

<div class="usage">
<div class="left">
	<p><span class="box">V</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">い-Adj</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">な-Adj + な</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">N + な</span></p>
</div>
	<p class="right">+ んだって・んですって</p>
</div>

Used to quote something that you heard in a casual conversation.
Similar in the quotation sense to [[Description#って・って言う・と言う|って]], but here the nuance is that the information is new or unexpected.

> [!info] Example
> ワールドカップでアルゼンチンが{勝|か}した==んだって==!
> Argentina won the world cup! (you just saw it on TV but you were doing something else and are surprised)

## と聞いた

Used for something you heard by someone identifiable: for example, you were told by someone.
Mostly used formally.

> [!info] Example
> 彼はバカ==と聞いた==。
> They say he's an idiot (I've heard that he's an idiot).

## と言われている

Used when you heard something, but not from someone specifically identifiable: general knowledge, a rumour, etc.
For nouns, だ is placed before.
Mostly used formally.

> [!info] Example
> このレストランのカレーはおいしいだ==と言われています==。
> They say the curry of this restaurant is good.

## そうだ

<div class="usage">
<div class="left">
	<p><span class="box">V (casual)</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">い-Adj</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">な-Adj + だ</span></p>
	<p><span class="box">N + だ</span></p>
</div>
	<p class="right">+ そうだ</p>
</div>

Means "I heard that".
Do not confuse with [[Observation - looking like#そうだ]] (no stem modification).
It is casual.

> [!info] Examples
> テストは{難|むず}しいだ==そうだ==。
> The exam is said to be difficult.

## ということだ

It is used for hearsay. Has a nuance of being sure of the validity.
Can also be used for a meaning close to "this means".
More formal than そうだ.
Can be used as ==ということだ== or ==とのことだ==. A more casual version is ==ってことだ==.

> [!info] Examples
> {専門家|せん|もん|か}によると、{今年|ことし}の{夏|なつ}は{最高|さいこう}{暑|あつ}くなる==ということです==。
> According to the experts, this summer will be the hottest ever.
