# Observation: looking like

## よう

Means that it looks like. Used from direct knowledge or experience, with a high degree of confidence.

It has two meanings:
* Looks like something: visual observation. Similar to みたい, but more polite.
* Perhaps it is. Might be something else, but it look like it is.

Contrary to そう, focuses on the more logical aspect of things.
