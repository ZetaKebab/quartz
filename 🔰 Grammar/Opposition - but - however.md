# Opposition: but, however

## が

Between two sentences, it has the meaning of "but".

> [!info] Example
> この{建物|たてもの}は大きいです==が==、トイレは{一|ひと}つだけあります。
> This building is huge but has only one toilet.

## でも

This is the basic way to say "but".

> [!info] Example
> コンビニに行きました。==でも==、何も買わなかった。
> I went to the convenience store. But I didn't buy anything.

⚠ Do not confuse with [[TeF (4) - even if#Even if ても・でも]].

## しかし

This is similar to でも, meaning "however", but usually more formal and most commonly found in written form.

> [!info] Example
> {戦争|せん|そう}は{悪|わる}いこと。==しかし==、{人類|じん|るい}はいつも{戦|たたか}っています
> War is bad. However, humanity is always fighting.

## けど・けれども

Means "but". Contrary to でも (which is more stand-alone), this links two clauses. The second clause can also be implicit and not said.
けれども is more formal than けど. 

> [!info] Example
> {外|そと}は{暑|あつ}い==けど==行きたい。
> It's hot outside but I'd still like to go.

It can also be used to soften your assertion.

> [!info] Example
> {明日|あした}に行きたい==けど==。
> I'd like to go tomorrow... (but I don't want to cause any inconvenience).

## 「ん・の」「だけど・ですけど」

Means "but", "however". 
の is more formal than ん, and ですけど is more formal than だけど.

> [!info] Example
> {手伝|てつだ}いたい==んですけど=={暇|ひま}はない。
> I'd like to help but I don't have time.
